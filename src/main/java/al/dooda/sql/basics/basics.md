# What Are Relational Databases?

    A relational database is a collection of data points with pre-defined relationships between them.

    use a structure that allows data to be organized into tables with rows and columns

    Key features:
        - Use of SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data
        - Support for ACID transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
        - Enforcement of data integrity through constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys)
        - Ability to establish relationships between tables, enabling complex queries and data retrieval
        - Scalability and support for multi-user environments


# RDBMS Benefits and Limitations        
    Here are some of the benefits of using an RDBMS:
        - Structured Data : **RDBMS allows data storage in a structured way, using rows and columns in tables. 
            This makes it easy to manipulate the data using SQL (Structured Query Language), ensuring efficient and flexible usage.
        - ACID Properties: ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. 
            These properties ensure reliable and safe data manipulation in a RDBMS, making it suitable for mission-critical applications.
        - Normalization: RDBMS supports data normalization, a process that organizes data in a way 
            that reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity.
        - Scalability: RDBMSs generally provide good scalability options, allowing for the addition 
            of more storage or computational resources as the data and workload grow.
        - Data Integrity: RDBMS provides mechanisms like constraints, primary keys, 
            and foreign keys to enforce data integrity and consistency, ensuring that the data is accurate and reliable.
        - Security: RDBMSs offer various security features such as user authentication, access control, 
            and data encryption to protect sensitive data.

    Here are some of the limitations of using an RDBMS:
        - Complexity :  It requires technical knowledge and skills to manage, tune, and optimize the database.
        - Cost: RDBMSs can be expensive, both in terms of licensing fees and the computational and storage resources they require.
        - Fixed Schema: RDBMS follows a rigid schema for data organization, which means any changes to the schema can be time-consuming and complicated.
        - Handling of Unstructured Data
