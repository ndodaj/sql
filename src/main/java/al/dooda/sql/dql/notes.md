Data Query Language (DQL) is a subset of SQL used to query and retrieve data from a database. 
It focuses on the SELECT statement, which is the most commonly used SQL command to fetch records from one or more tables. 
While DQL is not formally recognized as a separate language in the SQL standard, it is often categorized this way for convenience.

# Key Features of DQL
    - Queries data from the database.
    - Retrieves data based on specific conditions or filters.
    - Allows sorting, grouping, and aggregation of data.
    - Works in conjunction with other SQL clauses like WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and functions like SUM, COUNT, etc.

# Core syntax
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    [WHERE condition]
    [GROUP BY column]
    [HAVING condition]
    [ORDER BY column [ASC|DESC]];

# Importance of DQL
    - DQL is the heart of SQL for interacting with data in a meaningful way.
    - It allows data analysis, reporting, and generating insights by retrieving and aggregating data effectively.
