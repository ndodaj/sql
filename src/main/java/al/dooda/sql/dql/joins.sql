/**
  SQL JOINs are clauses used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
  They allow retrieval of data from multiple tables in a single query, enabling complex data analysis and reporting.
  The main types of JOINs include:
        - INNER JOIN (returns matching rows from both tables)
        - LEFT JOIN (returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right)
        - RIGHT JOIN (opposite of LEFT JOIN)
        - FULL JOIN (returns all rows when thereâ€™s a match in either table)

  JOINs are fundamental to relational database operations,
  facilitating data integration and exploration across related datasets.
