-- DROP is used to to completely remove a table from the database
-- this deletes the table structure along with all the data in it,
-- as well as any associated indexes, constraints, and triggers
-- Unlike TRUNCATE, which removes only the data, but keeps the table, DROP removes everything

DROP {table, schema, sequence, type, view ...};
