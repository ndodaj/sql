/**
  In SQL, a row (also called a record or tuple) represents a single, implicitly structured data item in a table.
  Each row contains a set of related data elements corresponding to the tableâ€™s columns.
  Rows are fundamental to the relational database model, allowing for the organized storage and retrieval of information.
  Operations like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE typically work at the row level.
