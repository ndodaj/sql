/**

  A scalar value is a single data item, as opposed to a set or array of values.
  Scalar subqueries are queries that return exactly one column and one row, often used in SELECT statements,
  WHERE clauses, or as part of expressions. Scalar functions in SQL return a single value based on input parameters.
  Understanding scalar concepts is crucial for writing efficient and precise SQL queries.
