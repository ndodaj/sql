# What is a database??
    - A database is a collection of related information

     - Database Management Systems (DBMS) make it easy to create, maintain and secure a database
     - DBMS allow us to preform CRUD operations and other administrative tasks
     - There are 2 types of databases: Relational and Non-Relational
     - Relational databases use SQL and store data in tables with rows and columns
     - Non-relational databases store data using other data structures

# Structured query language
    - SQL is a language used for interacting with Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
    - We can use sql to get RDBMS to do thing for us:
        crud, create & manage databases, design & create database tables,
        perform administrative tasks(security, user management, import/export)
    - The implementation of sql may vary a bit on different RDBMS (Oracle, Mysql, Postgresql)

    SQL is actually a hybrid language, its basically 4 types of languages in one
        - Data Query Language (DQL)
            - used to query the database for information
        - Data Definition Language (DDL)
            - used for defining database schemas
        - Data Control Language
            - used for controlling access to the data in database
        - Data Manipulation Language (DML)
            - used for inserting, updating, deleting data from the database
        - Transaction Control Language (TCL)


# Queries
    A query is a set of instructions given to the RDBMS (written in SQL)
